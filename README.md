## ATI Focus Mode

A lightweight Chrome extension for the ATI study platform that hides distracting UI elements so you can focus on the content. Designed to reduce timer anxiety and visual clutter during study sessions.

### Features

**Focus Mode Toggle**: Hide or restore all targeted elements instantly using the badge button or keyboard shortcut. Everything comes back exactly as it was when you toggle off.

**Keyboard Shortcut**: Press **Option + H (⌥H)** from anywhere on the page — works whether your focus is in the main page or the reading iframe.

**Persistent State**: Focus mode stays on as you navigate between pages within the same session.

**Zero Interference**: Nothing is stopped, broken, or modified on the backend. Only the visual display is affected. The timer still runs; you just can't see it.

**Always Hidden**: The live "Time spent" timer counter is hidden at all times, even when Focus Mode is off. I hate the timer so much I took it away from everyone.

### What Gets Hidden in Focus Mode

- Top white header (ATI logo, book title, AI search, Close button)
- Blue sub-header (hamburger menu, module title)
- Main navigation bar (course title, Search, My Annotations, Settings & Help)
- Page tools toolbar (Audio Tools, annotation controls)
- TTS read-along overlay
- Bottom pagination footer
- Prev/Next navigation footer
- Back-to-top button
- Pendo help badge

### How to Use

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Press **⌥H** (Option + H) | Toggle Focus Mode on/off |
| Click the **badge button** (bottom right) | Toggle Focus Mode on/off |

The badge reads **Focus OFF** when elements are visible and **Focus ON** when they are hidden.

### Installation

Since this extension is not yet on the Chrome Web Store, you must sideload it:

1. Download or clone this repository to your computer (click **Code** → **Download ZIP**)
2. Unzip the downloaded file
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle in the top-right corner
5. Click **Load unpacked**
6. Select the unzipped folder containing the extension files
7. Navigate to ATI — the extension is now active

To update after making changes to the files, return to `chrome://extensions/` and click the refresh icon on the extension card, then hard-refresh the ATI page with **⌘ + Shift + R**.

### Adding or Removing Hidden Elements

Open `content.js` and find the `SELECTORS` array near the top of the file. Each line is a CSS selector for one targeted element. Add a new line to hide something additional, or delete a line to stop hiding it. See the comments in the file for guidance on finding selectors using Chrome DevTools.

After any edit, reload the extension at `chrome://extensions/` and hard-refresh the ATI page.
